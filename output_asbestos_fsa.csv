It will be treated appropriately as a type 1 abatement and only removed with hand tools so not get any contamination into the air. There will only be one person on site doing the abatement, he has bit fit tested and will have completed his asbestos awareness training course. Furthermore we have developed SWP for this type of asbestos abetment and a tool box talk around it. He will be in full PPE (full face respirator, full TYVEK suite, Nitrile gloves). The control plan is to double bag tiles in appropriate 3mil yellow hazard bags and have Waste Management take them to the designated hazardous materials spot at the dump. I have gone over this plan with Eric Yang from WHS and I will have documentation of Fit test, asbestos awareness training certificate, SWP and tool box talk.
